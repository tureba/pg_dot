    pg_dot is a script that reverse engineers the database diagram from
    PostgreSQL system tables. It tries to generate a diagram as similar as
    possible to the intended Entity-Relationship Model used, including
    generalizations/specializations, unnormalized attributes and other
    abstractions that are hidden inside the database.

    This script is similar to the famous postgresql_autodoc script, but
    generates output only for graphviz. Also unlike postgresql_autodoc,
    pg_dot handles table hierarchy and will soon support unnormalized
    attributes, weak relationships, schemas and anything else I can
    implement.

    How to use:
        1 - Make sure the environment variables that PostgreSQL uses are
            defined and pointing to the correct server and database. The
            variables are PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER and PGDATABASE;
        2 - Make sure you have read access to the database. If it uses a
            password authentication, then set up a ~/.pgpass file adequately;
        3 - Execute the pg_dot script and it should result in a png file
            that describes the database diagram. The name of the file will be
            the name of the database consulted.
