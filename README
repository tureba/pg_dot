    pg_dot is a script that reverse engineers the database diagram from
    PostgreSQL system tables. It tries to generate a diagram as similar as
    possible to the intended Entity-Relationship Model used, including
    generalizations/specializations, unnormalized attributes and other
    abstractions that are hidden inside the database.

    This script is similar to the famous postgresql_autodoc script, but
    generates output only for graphviz. Also unlike postgresql_autodoc,
    pg_dot handles table hierarchy and will soon support unnormalized
    attributes, weak relationships and anything else I can implement.
